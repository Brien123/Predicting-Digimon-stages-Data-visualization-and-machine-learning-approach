# Predicting-Digimon-stages-Data-visualization-and-machine-learning-approach
This project aims to predict the stages of Digimon using data visualization and machine learning techniques. It utilizes the DigiDB_digimonlist dataset, which contains information about various Digimon, including their stages, types, attributes, and stats at level 50.

# Project Overview
The main objectives of this project are as follows:
- Clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure it is suitable for analysis and modeling.
- Perform exploratory data analysis and visualization to gain insights into the relationships and patterns within the dataset.
- Develop a machine learning model using the random forest classifier algorithm to predict the stages of Digimon based on the provided features.
- Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics and assess its accuracy in predicting the Digimon stages.
